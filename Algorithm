#Algorithm for minimum number in a list
Step1:-Begin the program
Step2:-Initialize the first number in the list as min_value
Step3:-For each element in the list compare it to the current value of min_value
Step4:-If the element is smaller than min_value, update the min_value to the value of the element
Step5:-Continue the process untile you have checked all the elements in the list
Step6:-At the end of the iteration min_value contains the minimum number in the lsit
Step7:-End the program
